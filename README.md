# Simple-Microcanonical-ensemble
A microcanonical ensemble is the statistical ensemble that is used to represent the possible states of a mechanical system which has an exactly specified total energy.

## Getting Started
The file [simulate.cpp](simulate.cpp) will do a simple molecular dynamics simulation of LJ Potential gas.

## Requirements
* C++ compiler 
* [mol.cpp](mol.cpp) - *For molecules*
* [vec.cpp](vec.cpp) - *For vectors*

## Configuration
* rCut - *Cut off distance for LJ potential*
* detaT - *Time step*
* stepAvg - *Average time for showing result*
* density - *Density of system*
* temperature - *Temperature of system*

## Built With
* [C++](https://isocpp.org/)
