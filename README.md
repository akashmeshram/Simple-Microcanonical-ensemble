# Simple-Microcanonical-ensemble
A microcanonical ensemble is the statistical ensemble that is used to represent the possible states of a mechanical system which has an exactly specified total energy.

## Getting Started
This program will do a simple molecular dynamics simulation of LJ Potential gas.
